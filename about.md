I am currently a Biostatistics PhD student in  Emory University, and my research interest mainly focus on application of statistics in medical image and genetics. 

I received my MS degree of DS from UW-Madison in 2020, and during my years in Madison, I worked under the supervision of Dr Sebastian Raschka to do some general research about computer vision, machine learning and deep learning method.

I obtained my BS degree of Statistics from  Nankai University in 2019, and also kept a minor of  finance.
