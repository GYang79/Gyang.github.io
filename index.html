Welcome! My name is Guangming and I am about to be a Biostatistics PhD student in Emory University 2020. I got my MS degree of DS from UW-Madison in 2020, and obtained my BS degree of Statistics from Nankai University in 2019. My research interest mainly focuses on Medical image, genetics and causal inference. And this webpage records the progress I would make in my PhD years.
